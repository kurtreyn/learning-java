- An interface lets us treat an instance of a single class as many different types
- The Bird class inherits behavior and attributes from Animals, because we used the extends keyword in the declaration of Bird
- Because the move method was abstract on Animals, Bird was required to implement it
- The Bird class also implements the Flyable interface
- This required the Bird class to implement the takeOff, fly, and land methods, the abstract methods on FlightEnabled
- Interfaces let us take objects, that may have almost nothing in common, and write reusable code, so we can process them all in a like manner
